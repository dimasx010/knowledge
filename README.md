## Why?
Throughout my experience there have been situations where even health has been compromised, so I think it is a good idea to share this knowledge and find a way to balance between life and the cloud.

## Why in english?
English is always a subject of controversy, so in this case it is not even negotiable, since most of the documentation and referents of this whole environment are mainly communicators in the English language.

So if you plan to dedicate yourself to the world of technology in general, English has become a mandatory tool to be able to develop in a more efficient way.
