# Rutime Environment

RTE (runtime environment) systems are sometimes referred to as runtime environments, although they are always referred to as runtime environments. What are they?

Simply put, runtime systems act like a small operating system and provide all the functionality that programs need to run. This includes everything from interfaces to physical hardware elements to user interactions and software components.

A runtime environment loads all the applications of a program and executes them on a platform. This platform makes available all the resources needed to run the program independently of the operating system. For example, the playback of audio and video web content is only possible if the appropriate runtime system, such as Adobe Flash Player, is available. If this environment is installed, flash web content is always played back with the same quality and functionality, regardless of browser or operating system.
