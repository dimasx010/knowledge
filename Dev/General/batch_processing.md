# Batch Processing

Batch processing is the method used by computers to periodically complete repetitive, high-volume data jobs. Certain data processing tasks, such as backups, filtering, and sorting, can be computationally intensive and inefficient to run on individual data transactions. Instead, data systems process these tasks in batches, often at off-peak times when computing resources are most frequently available, such as at the end of the day or overnight. For example, imagine an e-commerce system that receives orders throughout the day. Instead of processing all orders as they occur, the system could collect all orders at the end of each day and share them in a batch with the order fulfillment team.

Organizations use batch processing because it requires minimal human interaction and makes repetitive tasks run more efficiently. You can set up batches of jobs consisting of millions of records to process together when there is more computing power, putting less strain on your systems. Modern batch processing also requires minimal human supervision or administration. If there are any problems, the system automatically notifies the appropriate team to resolve them. Managers adopt a hands-off approach and trust their batch processing software to do its job. Here are more benefits of batch processing.
