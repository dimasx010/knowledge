# Hardcode

This term is used to define a programmer who codes almost his entire routine in a long procedure or function and, when it is time to change something, must rectify thousands of lines to achieve it.

Basically it is inferred to the management of manual setting of the routines so that they adapt to the scenario where we want to implement it.

For example, a currency converter where the initial values must be placed directly in the routines and not obtained by a foreign means, either through an api or by requesting it to the end user.
