# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a discipline in the field of Artificial Intelligence that, through algorithms, provides computers with the ability to identify patterns in massive data and make predictions (predictive analysis). This learning allows computers to perform specific tasks autonomously, i.e. without the need to be programmed.

The term was first used in 1959. However, it has gained relevance in recent years due to the increase in computing power and the data boom. Machine learning techniques are, in fact, a fundamental part of Big Data.

## Different Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine Learning algorithms are divided into three categories, the first two being the most common:

- Supervised learning: these algorithms have prior learning based on a system of labels associated with some data that allow them to make decisions or predictions. An example is a spam detector that labels an e-mail as spam or not depending on the patterns it has learned from the e-mail history (sender, text/image ratio, keywords in the subject, etc.).

- Unsupervised learning: these algorithms have no prior knowledge. They confront the chaos of data in order to find patterns that allow them to be organized in some way. For example, in the marketing field they are used to extract patterns from massive data from social networks and create highly segmented advertising campaigns.

- Reinforcement learning: its objective is for an algorithm to learn from its own experience. That is, it is capable of making the best decision in different situations according to a trial and error process in which correct decisions are rewarded. It is currently being used to enable facial recognition, make medical diagnoses or classify DNA sequences.
