# MySQL

MySQL is an open source relational database management system created by MySQL AB for web application development. It provides support for web developers to easily manage data using tables.

In most cases, MySQL works in conjunction with PHP, Apache web servers and Linux distributions. It is modifiable using Structured Query Language (SQL).

The popularity of the relational database increased when WordPress adopted it in its system. As MySQL database is compatible with Linux, it is included in its distributions, including Ubuntu.

These are the advantages and disadvantages of MySQL versus MariaDB.

## Pros:

Built-in data masking and dynamic columns make it a secure and fast database system. Thanks to its simple design and multiple storage engines, MySQL can guarantee optimal performance and continuous uptime.

Although it excels in data management for web applications, MySQL can be adapted to different use cases. For example, MySQL is well suited for e-commerce platforms, as it has strong transactional support. It also has advanced data security features that protect transactions.

Backed by Oracle Corporation, MySQL offers excellent compatibility. It is compatible with most hosting providers and more than 20 operating systems, making it platform-independent. In addition, MySQL is constantly updated and well documented.

Finally, MySQL is easy to use and customizable, with multiple user interfaces to suit different preferences.

## Disadvantages:

Migrating from MariaDB to MySQL is not as easy as the other way around due to replication configuration differences.

MySQL is also not compatible with the Oracle database. One of the reasons is that MySQL does not support PL/SQL, an application-oriented language developed by Oracle. In comparison, MariaDB comes with Oracle PL/SQL support, starting with version 10.3.

In addition, MySQL is not suitable for managing big data, as it lacks a robust memory-centric search engine and a large-scale data processing solution. MySQL's dual licensing model also locks essential features such as the thread pool plugin behind a paywall.

The restrictions and monetization that Oracle has implemented make MySQL difficult to scale. Despite being open source, Oracle has full control over the development and patching of the database system.
