# Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. You know how MySQL and PostgreSQL combine the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. Code, tools and applications currently used with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases can be used with Aurora. With some workloads, Aurora can provide up to five times the performance of MySQL and up to three times the performance of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most existing applications.

Aurora includes a high-performance storage subsystem. Its MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible database engines are customized to take advantage of its rapidly distributed storage. The underlying storage grows automatically as needed. An Aurora cluster volume can grow to a maximum size of 128 tebibytes (TiB). Aurora also automates and standardizes clustering and database replication, which are often some of the most problematic aspects of database configuration and administration.

Aurora is part of the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) managed database service. Amazon RDS is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate and scale a relational database in the cloud.
