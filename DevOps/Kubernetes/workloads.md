Workloads in Kubernetes refer to applications running on the platform that offer the user a number of new features, such as the option to not manage each of the Kubernetes pods directly, but to use the resources of these workloads to manage a set of pods.

The workloads' own resources in Kubernetes are also responsible for the configuration of controllers in the system, which ensure that the right number and type of pods are executed so that the actual system state can match the desired system state.

Kubernetes workloads also perform tasks related to pod autoscaling (with tools such as Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) and cluster autoscaling (with options such as Cluster Autoscaling).
