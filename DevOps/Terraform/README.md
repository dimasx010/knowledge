# Terraform information

Terraform is a software configuration tool designed to enhance the automation of multiple processes through concepts such as infrastructure as code. Through its language, it allows the creation of definitions (called resources) of infrastructure objects or resources.

Its main objective is to facilitate the creation of infrastructure in a declarative way, for example a data center in services such as Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In other words, this configuration is stored in the cloud and makes it possible to automate an infrastructure.

## Terraform consists of elements such as:

Terraform Core. It consists of receiving the information and making decisions with it.
Providers. They are the tools with which the infrastructure is created.

## What can you do with Terraform?

Terraform's own website proposes several scenarios in which this technology could be used:

Automating digital infrastructure: servers, databases, firewall....

Managing a multi-cloud environment (AWS, Azure, GCP...) despite its different interfaces or workflows. This is ideal when the environment has been built before deploying Terraform and you have to manage different cloud environments. In any case, you can also manage a single application from a single vendor.

Manage Kubernetes clusters and virtual machine images. For the latter, HCP 

Packer collects images from multi-cloud environments and can provision them for an API.

Configurations can be shared and reused as needed.

From the Terraform website it is possible to access its open source code and contribute to this collaborative project.

## Terraform benefits for businesses

One of the main benefits of Terraform for enterprises is that, by having a declarative language that abstracts the resources of multiple cloud providers (such as the very popular Azure, AWS and GCP) under a common syntax, it facilitates the implementation of infrastructure in a much more agile way, with less cost in time and adaptation on the part of the developer. In addition, this allows the infrastructure to be moved to another service.

Also, as we saw earlier, Terraform helps in the increasingly attractive automation of enterprises. Workflow automation can be brought into many different departments and integrated into their dynamics. This same flow allows a strong security control, with information access controls.

Moreover, the language it uses, called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language, after the company that created it), is very easy to use, which facilitates its use. And as if these were not enough benefits, let's remember that Terraform works with a code that is open and can be downloaded to be executed locally.
