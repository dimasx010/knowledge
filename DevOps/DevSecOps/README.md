# DevSecOps

DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security testing into every stage of the software development process. It includes tools and processes that foster collaboration between developers, security specialists and operations teams to create software that is efficient and secure. DevSecOps brings a cultural transformation that makes security a shared responsibility for everyone who creates software.

## What does DevSecOps mean?
DevSecOps stands for development, security and operations. It is an extension of the DevOps practice. Each term defines different roles and responsibilities of software teams when creating software applications.


### Development 
Development is the process of planning, coding, creating and testing the application.

### Security
Security means introducing security early in the software development cycle. For example, programmers ensure that code is free of security vulnerabilities and security professionals test software more thoroughly before the company releases it.

### Operations
The operations team publishes, monitors and corrects any issues arising from the software.

## Software development life cycle

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides software teams to produce high-quality applications. Software teams use the SDLC to reduce costs, minimize bugs, and ensure that software aligns with project goals at all times. The software development lifecycle leads software teams through these

- Requirements analysis
- Planning
- Architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Implementation

## DevSecOps in SDLC(The software development lifecycle)

In conventional software development methods, security testing was a separate process from the SDLC. The security team discovered security flaws only after the software was created. The DevSecOps framework enhances the SDLC by detecting vulnerabilities throughout the software development and delivery process.
