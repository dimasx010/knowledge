# Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

It is a static analysis tool that evaluates the source code of an application to identify security vulnerabilities before it is deployed in a real production environment.

SAST tools scan application source code for common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, command injections, among others. They are very useful for identifying security issues early in the software development lifecycle, allowing developers to fix problems before the application is deployed. 

Some of the most popular SAST tools include Checkmarx, Veracode, Fortify, Klocwork, SonarQube, among others.

It is important to note that they are not able to identify all security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is recommended to use DAST, SAST and SCA security tools for risk analysis.
