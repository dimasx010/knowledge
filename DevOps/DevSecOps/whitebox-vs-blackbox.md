# Testing White Box vs Testing Black Box

## Testing White Box

White box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method which looks at the code and structure of the product to be tested and uses that knowledge for testing.

This method is used in the unit testing phase, although it can also occur in other phases such as system or integration testing.  For the execution of this method it is necessary that the tester or the person who is going to use the method has extensive knowledge of the technology and architecture used to develop the program.

## Testing Black Boxâ€‹

It is the method in which the element is studied from the point of view of the inputs it receives and the outputs or responses it produces, without taking into account its internal functioning. These tests are performed from the graphical interface.
