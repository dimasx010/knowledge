Among the DAST, SAST and SCA (Software Composition Analysis) security tools, the latter is a security tool that focuses on scanning the source code and/or distribution package of the application to identify the third-party libraries and components that are used. SCA tools then analyze these libraries and components to identify known security vulnerabilities, as well as to assess software quality and security policy compliance.

Third-party libraries and components are an integral part of most modern applications, and often contain known security vulnerabilities. Some of the most popular SCA tools include Black Duck, Snyk, Sonatype, WhiteSource, among others.

It is important to note that although SCA tools are very useful for identifying vulnerabilities in libraries and third-party components, they are not capable of identifying all security vulnerabilities in an application. Therefore, it is advisable to complement security testing with DAST and SAST tools and manual security testing.
