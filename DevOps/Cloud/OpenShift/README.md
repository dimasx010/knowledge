Basically this is a development platform with Cloud Computing (PaaS) features developed by Red Hat, basically it is a certified Kubernetes distribution.

It has a number of features: 

- It focuses on application development.
- Openshift uses Docker and Kubernetes internally.
- It allows us to deploy applications in different environments (Development, production).
- It facilitates continuous integration.
- We have several ways to interact with OpenShift: web application, CLI or REST API.

It also offers a number of advantages: 

- You can automatically create images or containers, taking repos from github for example. 
- You do not need a professional management of the infra at least at the beginning of your application. 

Currently we have several solutions available among which we can mention: 

- OKD(Origin): The community distribution that you can install on your infrastructure. 
- OpenShift Online: Version running on Red Hat's public cloud. Two plans: Free and Pro. 
- OpenShift Dedicated: Allows you to have an OpenShift cluster managed by Red Hat to deploy your applications.
- OpenShift Container Platform: allows you to have an OpenShift cluster on your own infrastructure managed by Red Hat.
