# AWS CloudFront

Amazon CloudFront can be defined as a type of content delivery network or CDN service that delivers content securely, with low latency and high transfer speed.

This system enables its customers to reach viewers globally in as little as milliseconds, including edge computing capabilities, field encryption and integrated data understanding.

The features and design of the Amazon CloudFront tool contribute to the delivery of high performance, a higher level of security and greater convenience for cloud developers who are AWS customers to perform their activities on the platform.

In addition to knowing what Amazon CloudFront is, it is important to know the set of features and properties included in this system, as these enable its operation. We can highlight, for example, that it is a web service that is responsible for making faster the distribution of content, both dynamic and static, such as .html, .css or .js files, as well as other image files to users.

Amazon CloudFront also has the ability to deliver its content using a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.

In addition, Amazon CloudFront enables faster content distribution by directing requests through the Amazon Web Service (AWS) backbone to the edge location that offers the best conditions for the content.

Another feature of the Amazon CloudFront system is that it allows for an increase in the security levels of deliveries, using traffic encryption and access controls. It should be noted that the user also has the possibility of linking other tools, such as AWS Shield Standard, so that it can defend against DDoS attacks without representing any additional cost.

This Amazon tool can also be used to automatically adjust scale, allowing software delivery and game updates at scale with high transfer rates.

Amazon CloudFront is also characterized by linking with telecommunications providers globally, as well as including an efficient connection to major access networks to ensure optimal performance of its services.
