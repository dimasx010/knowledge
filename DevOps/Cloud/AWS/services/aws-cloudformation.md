# AWS Cloudformation

AWS CloudFormation is defined as a service that helps model, provision and manage Amazon Web Service and third-party system resources by treating infrastructure as code.

This means that using AWS CloudFormation helps reduce the time the user has to spend on direct resource management, allowing them to focus on managing applications running on AWS.

## Features 

Among the main features of the AWS CloudFormation system is that it enables fast and consistent provisioning of resources throughout their lifecycle.

This means that resource lifecycles can be managed in a predictable, repeatable and secure manner, allowing for automated restores and health monitoring by the AWS CloudFormation system itself.

This tool also includes the template element where resources and their dependencies are described, so that they can be configured and launched together as an AWS CloudFormation stack.

So these templates can be deployed to perform the processes of creating, updating and deleting a whole set of resources as a single unit, instead of doing it individually.

Another feature of AWS CloudFormation is that it has the ability to perform the tasks related to the creation and tuning of system resources.

In addition, this tool allows you to scale the infrastructure while managing resources in the regions and accounts of the platform with just one operation.
