The AWS Management Console is a web application that encompasses and references a broad set of service consoles for managing AWS resources. The first time you log in, you will see the console home page. The home page provides access to each service's console and offers a single place to access the information you need to perform your AWS-related tasks. It also allows you to customize the console home page experience by adding, removing, and rearranging widgets such as Recently visited, AWS Health, Trusted Advisor, and others.
