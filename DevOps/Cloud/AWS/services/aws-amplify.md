# AWS Amplify

According to its creator, AWS Amplify is "the fastest and easiest way to create scalable web and mobile applications". This means that, with the toolkit and services it offers, you can develop, from scratch, both the back-end and front-end of an app in very few steps.

In addition, it is also possible to connect any repository and host it in the AWS Amplify console in a simple way. From there, the application can be configured, adding back-end and front-end elements, and then deployed on the network.

It is also worth noting that AWS Amplify or Amazon Amplify allows you to manage application content even for non-developers. To do this, anyone with administrative access can do so through the AWS Amplify administration user interface.

In parallel, it is worth mentioning that AWS Amplify or Amazon Amplify allows you to create the same mobile app back-end for different operating systems: Android, IOS, React Native, Ionic and Flutter. As for web platforms, it supports JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue and Next.js.

## Benefits of AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify offers both hosting services, by connecting an already created repository, and the possibility of building an application from scratch. In the latter case, it can be done in three steps, as our guest demonstrates in the webinar.

Likewise, for any of its applications, AWS Amplify stands out for the flexibility and simplicity of domain configuration and accesses, real-time interaction and file distribution, the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and campaign personalization, to mention the highlights.

In short, the great advantage of AWS Amplify is the possibility of creating and configuring web and mobile applications, quite sophisticated and in an easy and fast way, without having to generate code. Likewise, it highlights its performance, adaptability and security.
