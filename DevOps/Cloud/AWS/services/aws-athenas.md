# AWS Athena

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) with standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena to data stored in Amazon S3 and start using standard SQL to run ad hoc queries and get results in seconds.

Athena helps us to analyze unstructured, semi-structured and structured data stored in Amazon S3. Some examples are CSV, JSON or columnar formatted data, such as Apache Parquet and Apache ORC. You can use Athena to run ad hoc queries with ANSI SQL and without the need to aggregate the data or load it into Athena.
