To this end, this platform collects operational and monitoring data in the form of logs, metrics and events. In this way, you have a picture of the entire operational status and complete visualization of AWS applications, resources and services running on AWS and its equipment.

Similarly, Amazon CloudWatch features include detecting anomalous behavior in your space, setting alarms, comparing logs and metrics, automated actions, troubleshooting, and finally, searching for information to maintain proper health of your applications.

Amazon CloudWatch works by collecting information and observation based on logs, metrics and events. The data obtained is observed in automated dashboards to generate a total perspective of Amazon Web Service (AWS) resources, applications and services.

Similarly, thanks to the correlation of data, it can generate resource optimization and thus improve the state. In terms of monitoring, for example, you can set alarms that identify anomalous metric behaviors according to Machine Learning algorithms.

## Advantages of Amazon CloudWatch

The implementation of the Amazon CloudWatch platform includes a number of advantages or benefits for its users, such as:

- Using the service of a single tool for overall system monitoring and observation.
- Collection of AWS metrics, which can be used for further analysis and decision making based on their results.
- Sets alarms and provides resource automation to avoid spending time performing monitoring activities manually.
- Provides a standard operating picture, detailed real-time data and a historical reference.
- Operational troubleshooting through log visualization.
