# AWS Well Architected

AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects create a secure, high-performance, resilient and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads. This framework, built around six pillars (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization and sustainability), provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework includes domain-specific approaches, hands-on labs, and the AWS Well-Architected Tool. AWS Well-Architected Tool, available at no cost in the AWS Management Console, provides a mechanism to regularly assess workloads, identify high-risk issues, and record improvements.

## AWS Well-Architected and the Six Pillars

AWS Well-Architected Framework describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud. Answer a set of basic questions to discover how well your architecture aligns with cloud best practices and get guidance on how to improve it.

### Operational excellence pillar

The operational excellence pillar focuses on executing and monitoring systems and constantly improving processes and procedures. Key issues include automating changes, responding to events and defining standards to manage daily operations, thereby improving: 

- The organization
- Preparedness
- Operation
- Evolution

Among the recommendations to visualize in this pillar we have: 

- Understand business priorities.
- Design according to operations.
- Assess operational readiness. 
- Understand workload and operational status.
- Prepare for and respond to events. 
- Learn from experience, share learnings and make improvements. 

### Safety pillar

The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key issues include confidentiality and data integrity, administration of user permissions and the establishment of controls to detect security events, thereby affecting: 

- The administration of access identities. 
- Detection
- Infrastructure protection
- Data protection
- Incident response.

Among the recommendations to be visualized in this pillar we have: 

- Protect information, systems and assets.
- Protect root account credentials.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit in AWS in various ways if applicable.
- Ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access your resources. 
- Use detection controls to locate or identify a security breach.

### Reliability pillar

The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failures to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning and how to adapt to changing requirements, we improve: 

- Basics
- Workload architecture
- Change management
- Error Management

### Performance efficiency pillar

The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and simplified IT allocation and computing resources. Key topics include selecting the types and sizes of resources optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve, improve:

- Resource Selection
- Reviewing
- Monitoring
- Trade-off analysis.

Among the recommendations to visualize in this pillar we have: 

- Utilization of computational resources in an efficient manner to satisfy system requirements.
- Selection of appropriate resource types.
- Benchmark and load testing
- Performance monitoring
- Optimization of resource location, data and processing.

### Cost optimization pillar

The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary expenses. Key issues include understanding time spent and controlling the allocation of funds, selecting resources for the right type and amount, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending, thereby improving:

- Financial management practice in the cloud.
- Knowledge of spending and usage.
- Profitable Resources
- Resource demand and supply management 
- Optimization over time.
