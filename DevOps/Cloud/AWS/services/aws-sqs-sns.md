SNS is a distributed publishing and subscription system. Messages are sent to subscribers as publishers send them to SNS.

SQS is a distributed queuing system. Messages are not sent to receivers. Receivers have to poll or pull messages from SQS . Messages cannot be received by multiple receivers at the same time. Any receiver can receive a message, process it and delete it. Other receivers do not receive the same message later. Polling inherently introduces some latency in message delivery in SQS, unlike SNS, where messages are sent immediately to subscribers. SNS supports multiple endpoints, such as email, SMS, HTTP endpoint and SQS. If you want an unknown number and type of subscribers to receive messages, you need SNS.

You do not have to couple SNS and SQS every time. You can have SNS send messages to the email, SMS or HTTP endpoint in addition to SQS. There are advantages to combining SNS with SQS. You may not want an external service making connections to your hosts (a firewall may block all incoming connections to your host from the outside).

Your endpoint may simply die due to the sheer volume of messages. Email and SMS may not be your choice for processing messages quickly. By combining SNS with SQS, you can receive messages at your own pace. It allows customers to be offline, tolerant to network and host failures. You also get guaranteed delivery. If you configure SNS to send messages to an HTTP endpoint or email or SMS, multiple message delivery failures can cause messages to be dropped.

SQS is mainly used to decouple applications or integrate applications. Messages can be stored in SQS for a short period of time (maximum 14 days). SNS distributes multiple copies of messages to multiple subscribers. For example, suppose you want to replicate data generated by an application to multiple storage systems. You can use SNS and send this data to several subscribers, each of which replicates the messages it receives on different storage systems (S3, hard disk on your host, database, etc.).
