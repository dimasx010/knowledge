# AWS DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that delivers fast, predictable performance and seamless scalability. DynamoDB allows you to delegate the administrative burdens of running and scaling distributed databases, so you don't have to worry about provisioning, installing and configuring hardware, replication, software patching or cluster scaling. DynamoDB also offers encryption at rest, which eliminates the burden and operational complexity of protecting sensitive information. For more information, see Encryption at Rest in DynamoDB.

With DynamoDB, you can create database tables capable of storing and retrieving any amount of data, as well as handling any level of request traffic. You can scale the throughput capacity of your tables up or down without downtime or performance degradation. You can use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.

DynamoDB provides deferred backup functionality. It allows you to create full backups of tables for long-term retention and archiving to meet regulatory compliance requirements. For more information, see Using On-Demand Backup and Restore for DynamoDB.

You can create delayed backups as well as enable point-in-time recovery backups for Amazon DynamoDB tables. Point-in-time recovery helps protect your tables from accidental write or delete operations. With point-in-time recovery, you can restore a table to any point in time within the last 35 days. For more information, see Recover to a point in time: how it works.

DynamoDB allows you to automatically delete expired items from tables, to help you reduce storage consumption and the cost of data that is no longer relevant. For more information, see Using DynamoDB's Time-To-Live (TTL) to expire items.
