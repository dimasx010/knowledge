AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. Use IAM; to control who is authenticated (logged in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

When you create an AWS Account, you start with a login identity that has full access to all AWS resources and Services in the account. This identity is given the AWS Account root user name and is accessed by logging in with the email and password you used to create the account. We recommend that you do not use the root user for everyday tasks. Protect the root user credentials and use them only for tasks that the root user can perform. For a complete list of tasks that require you to log in as the root user, see Tasks that require root user credentials in the AWS Account Management Reference Guide.
