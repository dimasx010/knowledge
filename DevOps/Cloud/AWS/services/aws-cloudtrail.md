AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, operations and risk audits of your AWS account. Actions taken by an AWS user, role, or service are logged as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS APIs and SDKs.

CloudTrail will be in yourAWS account when you create it. When activity occurs in yourAWS account, it is logged in a CloudTrail event. You can easily view recent CloudTrail events in the Event History.

Visibility into your AWS account activity is a key aspect of security and operational best practices. CloudTrail can use account activity in your AWS infrastructure. You can identify who or what had to take action, what resources were acted upon, when the event occurred, and other details that will help you analyze and respond to an AWS account activity. You can also enableAWS CloudTrail Insights on a trace log to help you identify and respond to unusual activity.

You can CloudTrail integrate applications using the API, automate the creation of tracking logs for your organization, check the status of event data stores, and control how users view CloudTrail events.
