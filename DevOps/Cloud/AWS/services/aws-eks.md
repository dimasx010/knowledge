Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without having to install, operate, and maintain your own control plane or Kubernetes nodes. Kubernetes is an open source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Amazon EKS:

Runs and scales the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure high availability.

Automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces bad control plane instances, and provides automated version and patch updates for them.

Integrates with numerous AWS services to provide scalability and security for applications, including the following features:

- Amazon ECR for container images

- Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution

- IAM for authentication

- Amazon VPC for isolation

Runs up-to-date versions of the Kubernetes open source software so you can use all the existing plugins and tools in the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with those running in any standard Kubernetes environment, whether they are running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS, without having to modify the code in any way.
