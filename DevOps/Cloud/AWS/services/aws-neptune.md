# AWS Neptune

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, and fully managed graph database service that allows you to easily build and run applications that work with highly connected data sets. The core database data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data data This engine is optimized to store thousands of relationships and query the graph with millisecond millisecond latency. Neptune supports the popular Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and Neo4j's OpenCypher property graph query languages, and the W3C's RDF query language, SPARQL. This allows you to create queries that efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network security.

Neptune offers high availability, with read replication, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3 and replication in all availability zones. Neptune offers data security features, with this, you can use encryption at rest and in transit. Neptune is fully managed, so you no longer have to worry about database administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, software patching, configuration or backups.

With Amazon Neptune, you don't have to worry about database administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, software patching, configuration, or backups.

You can use Neptune to create sophisticated, interactive graphical applications that can query billions of relationships in milliseconds. SQL queries for highly connected data are complex and difficult to tune for performance. With Neptune, you can use the popular graph query languages Gremlin, OpenCypher and SPARQL to execute efficient queries that are easy to write and work well with connected data. This capability significantly reduces code complexity and enables you to build applications that process relationships faster

Neptune is designed to deliver greater than 99.99 percent availability. It increases database performance and availability by tightly integrating the database engine with an SSD-backed virtualized storage tier that is designed for database workloads. Neptune storage is fault tolerant and self-healing. Disk errors are repaired in the background without loss of database availability. Neptune automatically detects database crashes and restarts without the need to recover or rebuild the database cache. If an instance-wide error occurs, Neptune automatically failovers to one of the 15 replicas read.
