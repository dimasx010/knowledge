Six key areas affect the way you buy cloud: price, security, data residency, sustainability, governance, and terms and conditions. Failure to fully understand these areas can prevent you from gaining the full benefits of the cloud.

Here are some learnings to keep in mind when it comes to the key aspects of procurement:

- Cloud pricing is variable. They increase and decrease over time based on vendor pricing, it is not customer specific.

- The user has to assess the security and resiliency of the AWS physical infrastructure by using external accreditations, rather than being required to audit and assess these elements themselves. Utilizing these existing resources avoids overly burdensome processes and duplication.

- It is important to understand data sovereignty and residency from the outset to ensure that the user can maximize the benefits of the AWS cloud offering.

- Any analysis of the climate impact of a data center must take into account resource use and energy efficiency in addition to the energy mix. Large-scale CSPs use an energy mix that is 28% less carbon intensive than the global average.

- Cloud governance needs to be taken into account for the environment to function properly, which should be considered well in advance of procurement. Since the user retains control over their data, as part of any procurement strategy, the user needs to evaluate the capabilities of the CSP to meet their cloud governance needs.

- Cloud terms and conditions are designed to reflect how a cloud services model works (no physical assets are purchased). CSPs operate on a massive one-to-many scale to deliver standardized services and cannot customize services for individual customer needs. Therefore, it is important to engage with CSPs early on to incorporate and utilize their terms to the greatest extent possible.
