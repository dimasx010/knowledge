# AWS Cost Explorer

AWS Cost Explorer has a simple interface that allows you to visualize, understand and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. Get started quickly by creating custom reports that analyze cost and usage data. Analyze data on a general basis (e.g., total costs and usage across all accounts) or drill down to identify trends, determine cost drivers, and detect anomalies.

Among the use cases we have: 

- Create custom applications: 
Take advantage of direct access to the interactive ad-hoc analysis engine that powers AWS Cost Explorer. The Cost Explorer API allows you to programmatically query cost and usage data.

- Using granular filtering
View, understand and manage your AWS costs and usage at a monthly or daily granularity level. In addition, you can access your data at a higher granularity by enabling granularity by hour and resource.

- Cost forecasting
Create a forecast by selecting a future time interval for the report. You can use the forecast to calculate the AWS bill and set alarms and budgets based on the predictions.
