# AWS Budgets

With AWS Budgets, you set custom budgets to track costs and usage, and quickly respond to alerts you receive via email or SNS notifications when you exceed a limit.

Among its use cases we have:

- Monitor costs and usage:
Set your preferred budget period, whether daily, monthly, semi-annually or annually, and create specific budget limits.

- Create scheduled reports:
Stay informed on the progress of actual or projected costs and usage toward your budget threshold.

- Respond to thresholds:
Set up custom actions to be executed automatically or through an approval process when a budget target is exceeded.
